## Goal
{contract.goal.objective}

## Non-goals

## Constraints and permissions
- Profile: `{contract.profile}`
- Workspace root: `{contract.goal.workspace_root}`
- Executor: standard Hermes `/goal`; no production runner.

## Risks top 3
{chr(10).join(f'- {r.id}: {r.tag} — {r.mitigation or r.severity}' for r in contract.risks[:3]) or '- none'}

## Dependencies/order
- Phase order is derived from `CONTRACT.json` phase ordinals and dependencies.

## Assumptions
- Contract source is canonical; Markdown files are generated views.

## Memory hits applied
- none

## Tools/skills used
- chip-supergoal compiler

## Best practices applied
- deterministic rendering
- semantic validation

def render_loop_design(contract: Contract) -> str:
    return f"""# LOOP_DESIGN.md

## Goal
{contract.goal.objective}

## Context sources
- CONTRACT.json is the canonical source of truth.
- Workspace root: `{contract.goal.workspace_root}`.

## Host model
- Host: standard Hermes `/goal` executor running generated PROTOCOL.md.

## Reviewer / judge model
- Reviewer/judge: embedded RPD/Senior gate with pass/fail mutation requests.

## Verification gates
- Programmatic gate: python3 -m unittest discover -s tests.
- Package gate: python3 scripts/sgctl.py validate-package .supergoal --strict.

## State checkpoints
- STATE.md is generated at compile time and becomes a runtime checkpoint.
- Future v3 STATE.json supersedes STATE.md when present.

## Stop conditions
- Retry at most 3 times per failed gate.
- Stop only for real blockers or after 3 audit rounds.

## Budget
- phases: {len(contract.phases)}
- max iterations: {max(3, len(contract.phases) + 2)}
- audit rounds: 3

## Boundaries
- secrets, credentials, private data, public egress, payment, DNS, and production changes follow profile policy.
- No custom production runner.

## Failure recovery
- On validation failure: patch, retry, or handoff with blocker.
- On state/path drift: recover from disk-bound goal identity.

## Human approvals
- Required only for money, DNS, secrets, grants, destructive production, or public/mass sends.
